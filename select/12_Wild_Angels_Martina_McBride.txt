Between the perfect world and the bottom line
Keeping love alive in these troubled times
Well, It's a miracle in itself
And we know too well what that's about
Still we made it through, only God knows how
We must've had a little help
(Must've been)

CHORUS
Wild Angels, Wild Angels
Watching over you and me, yeah
Wild Angels, Wild Angels
Baby what else could it be

Well it must've been hard, it must've been tough
Keeping up with crazy fools like us
'Cause it's so easy to fall apart
We still break each other's heart sometimes
Spend some nights on the jagged side
Somehow we wake up in each other's arms
(Oh Must've been)

(REPEAT CHORUS)

BRIDGE
There are some nights
I watch you while you dream
I swear I hear the sound of beating wings, yeah
(Oh It Must've been)

Wild Angels, Wild Angels
Watching over you & me, yeah
Wild Angels, Wild, Wild Angels
Baby what else could it be

Wild Angels...

Wild Angels
