There's a place I can go
Where I know I'll always be welcome
Night after night
When your memory comes around,
I just take a ride down the road
And look for the light
When I see that old sign flashin'
That's when I know I'm on my way

I'm goin' out to the wild blue yonder
Break through this cloud I'm under
Out to the wild blue yonder
And let my mind wander away

Maybe I can find a friend there,
Someone who's been where I am
And knows what to do
With a heart that won't stop breakin'
And a mind that won't stop takin' me back
To the image of you
Tonight I know my destination
A place where no one knows you name

I'm goin' out to the wild blue yonder
Break through this cloud I'm under
Out to the wild blue yonder
And let my mind wander away

You know that jukebox sounds like thunder
When that whiskey pours like rain

I'm goin' out to the wild blue yonder
Break through this cloud I'm under
Out to the wild blue yonder
And let my mind wander away
