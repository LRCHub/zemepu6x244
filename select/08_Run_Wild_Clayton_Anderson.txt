We'll be hangin' on the edge tonight
I feel the rumble and a shake inside
An open road is no place to hide
And there's no turning back when you put it in drive

Roll, roll, roll, if you want it the most
Roll, roll, roll, if you're ready to go

All these horses need to run...
So let 'em run wild
So let 'em run wild

We're just some rebels here, without a cause
Every move is like we break the law
You're gonna lose if you ain't quick with the draw
Ain't no money left if you don't finish strong

Try, try, try, catch me if you can
Bye, bye, bye, I'm a wanted man

All these horses need to run...
All these horses need to run...
So let 'em run wild
So let 'em run wild

Try, try, try, catch me if you can
Bye, bye, bye, I'm a wanted man
Try, try, try, catch me if you can
Bye, bye, bye, I'm a wanted man

All these horses need to run...
All these horses need to run...
So let 'em run wild
So let 'em run wild
So let 'em run wild
So let 'em run wild
