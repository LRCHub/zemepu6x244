# BABYMONSTER – WILD

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
Look in the mirror
Checking my face
사람은 쉽게 안 변해
Don’t need a hero
Get outta my way
마음 가는 대로
Born to be brave
But it took a long long time
To realise
That I
별빛처럼 찬란한
꽃이 피게 할 거야
Just a little bit different
정답이 뭔데?
No no 정해진 건 없는데
Typical, logical
전부 똑같애
I’m gonna do what I wanna do
Dance all night
Until I feel alive
I think I’m ready
I think I’m ready to
Be myself
Not like everybody else
That’s not my style
I’d rather rather rather be wild
I keep it wild, I keep it free, I got that
dangerous in me
Hit the rodeo, that superstar, that one and only
Glowing, shining like a diamond
Trust me, you can’t beat this
BABY I’mma MONSTER
Leave ’em in the dust then I blow them a kiss
But it took a long long time
To realise
That I
별빛처럼 찬란한
꽃이 피게 할 거야
Just a little bit different
정답이 뭔데?
No no 정해진 건 없는데
Typical, logical
전부 똑같애
I’m gonna do what I wanna do
Dance all night
Until I feel alive
I think I’m ready
I think I’m ready to
Be myself
Not like everybody else
That’s not my style
I’d rather rather rather be wild
Out in the dark
Out on my own
내 안의 길을 따라서
언젠간 만나게 될
내 꿈속에서
I’m gonna dance all night
Until I feel alive
I think I’m ready
I think I’m ready to
Be myself
Not like everybody else
That’s not my style
I’d rather rather rather be wild
Ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya
I’d rather rather rather be wild
Ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya
I’d rather rather rather be wild
